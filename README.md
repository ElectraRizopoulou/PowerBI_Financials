# PowerBI_Financials
Interactive Power BI dashboard demonstrating KPIs, charts and with synced slicers

## Overview
This is a small Power BI project, using an Excel financial dataset.  
The dashboard includes:

- **KPI cards** showing total Sales, Profit, and COGS  
- **Charts** for Sales by Country and Sales by Year  
- **A Map view** with sales bubbles by country  
- **Slicers** for Country and Year, synced across pages  

## Purpose
I created this  to practice working with Power BI.  
Through this project, I focused on:

- Importing and visualizing data from Excel  
- Checking data accuracy and interactivity between visuals  
- Applying a basic testing mindset to verify results  
- Understanding where reporting fits into the software development process (SDLC)

## Usage
1. Download the `.pbix` file.  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Use the slicers to explore the data interactively.
4. The images below are depicting Mexico data exclusively
